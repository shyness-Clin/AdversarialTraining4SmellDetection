# Adversarially Enhanced Code Smell Detection
## Overview
This repository contains the code, datasets, and experimental setup for our research on adversarially enhanced code smell detection models. The study focuses on improving the robustness of deep learning-based models, particularly under adversarial conditions, using adversarial training strategies.

Our research specifically targets complex method code smells, which are challenging due to their large size, intricate control flow, and numerous dependencies. By incorporating adversarial training, we demonstrate improvements in model robustness and detection performance.
